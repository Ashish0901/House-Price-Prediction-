# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains a simple implementation of house price prediction using Linear Regression. The goal is to demonstrate how to build a basic linear regression model to predict house prices based on certain features of the house.

## Requirements

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the kaggle. It includes house features like square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, garage, and the target variable, price.

## Model Training

The linear regression model is trained using the training data. The model is saved for later use.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset, using R-squared (R2) metrics.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
